        <h2>Bare with me HAHAHAHHAHAHAH</h2>
        <p>I am really glad I just took the risk and have the confidence to ask you to open up to me and share a part of your life with me. Suprisingly you started
        with a very deep one then I shared one too and so on, we were exchanging stories from our past to the point it got deeper and as it goes I felt warmth
        in my body, you made me flutter by opening some of your deepest secrets and I felt a lot closer to you. That whole hour and a half I cant seem to forget that
        and I am replaying it all in my head until we got to the part where I give you the gifts, before that I didn't know if you noticed how nervous I am in the car
        asking if we could drop u off home since from then on I was trying to construct sentences on how I would give it to you. Fast forward to you openign the gifts
        I couldn't stop noticing howd ur eyes sparkle might be corny ut it did, every moment while I was jsut standing there i want to say a lot of things but couldn't
        in the end I only let go of few phrases which was "dont give up ok, just hold on" U dont know how many things I wanted to say to you I just couldn't because 
        tears were about to fall. I am so glad that day happened and I am really looking forward for more, I am craving for it hehe </p>

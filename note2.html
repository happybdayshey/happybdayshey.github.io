        <h2>Note 2</h2>
        <p>This note or message is for me to open up just in case I become too nervous. ok so here we go inhale exhale inhale exhale  sdjgfhlkdjashf hdg
        I LIKE YOU, I LIKE YOU A GREAT DEAL and I'm pretty sure you already know. From the very 1st interaction sa dc I will be honest. I didn't like you at all, 
        it was a 1st impression thing I thought you have to much ego and difficult to be with but idk it just snapped at me when were playing games, that I am 
        starting to like your company, your voice in calls, the laughs you make when you whiff hard, the calmness of your voice when the talk gets deep, the cute noises 
        u make even little ones. even tho I suck at it it was like it was never about the game but spending my times with you, all those things I keep yearning for it. 
        Then it came to mind that your bday was coming up we (me n whi) were in sm marikina why not invite her to go out sinabi ko nalng na libre ko para makadagdag sa 
        pag convince sayo (it works on my friends soo) then u agreed and that's where I earned a lot of money to spend, 1st thing come to mind is gifts and I thought about 
        our ineractions its valo and i remembered ur mouse sucks so I went and asked for a good yet affordable mouse so that's it then whi mentioned it would be better to have 
        another gift since he knows you well I asked what you like the most, that's it for the second gift. The 3rd gift was the leaast expensive but for me it had the most value
        I bought it 1 or 2 years ago basta matagal na, I was so amazed by it and it felt elegant, I bought it without thinking who it is for and just said to myself anyone 
        who will make me motivated like make me change myself for the better will be the one to recieve it. I have thought a lot about what you said in terms of dating u said 
        that u would prio career over the guy (correct me if I'm mistaken) or u would wanna settle around late 20s or early 30s what I'm trying to say is that I will not be 
        a hindrance to you or be a burden instead I'd like to be your break when things get rough, be your rest when things are to tiring and be your rant when this world is 
        pissing you off, I want to be with you through all that.</p>

        <p>I want to say more but if you're reading this it will take a while and I want to hear what you have to say.</p>
